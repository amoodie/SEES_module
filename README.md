# 2.0 Installation and setup guides

Visit the section of the text below for more information on installing and executing the FloodingModule program on your computer. 

_Note that if you have a full Matlab license,_ there is a section at the end for running the module from source. This method is recommended over using the MCR if possible.

## 2.1 Windows (Windows 10)
* Visit the 'download' folder of this repository ([https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach/tree/master/flooding_risk/download](./download)) and download the 64-bit Windows 10 FloodingModule installer.
* Run the installer by navigating to the download directory and executing the installer by double clicking. Note that you may have to run this as administrator, depending on where you intend to install the program and Matlab MCR.
* Follow the default options. If you must make any changes during the install process, be sure to note them (e.g., the install location), as you will may this information to run the module program.
* You can now run the program by navigating to the install location. 
  * note that the program may take up to a minute to launch the first time.
  
## 2.2 Mac OS


# 3.0 Disclaimer

This module utilizes a Matlab Compiled Runtime (MCR) program for backend calculations and plotting of the model results.
The program accompanying this module is to be run as a standalone application, but relies on the Matlab MCR; the program can be be downloaded at [http://www.coastalsustainability.rice.edu/outreach/](http://www.coastalsustainability.rice.edu/outreach/).
For help troubleshooting the Matlab executable, please visit [https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).
The source code can be viewed at [https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach](https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach).

The module was created by Andrew J. Moodie as part of an National Science Foundation funded research project assessing the sustainability of anthropogenically influenced deltas.
The research is supported by Grant No. 1427262 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to A.J.M. under Grant No. 1450681.
