# 1.0 Introduction

This module is called "Module for flow discharge and sediment load relation in a river". 
It is designed to predict the sediment load for given water discharge in a river. 
For specified channel bed slope, channel width, bed surface grain size, and channel resistance coefficient, it produces a graph showing the relation between water discharge and sediment load. 

Sediment transport is typically describes as a function of shear stress at the channel bed. In general, deeper flow corresponds to higher bed shear stress; hence sediment load increases with increasing water discharge. Wider channel tends to have less capacity of sediment transport because wider channel corresponds to shallower flow for given water discharge, therefore lower bed shear stress. When grain is fine, the sediment transport increases because fine sediment is easy to be picked up and carried away, compared to coarse grain. Higher bed resistance (e.g. bumpy bed) can reduce bed shear stress. That is to say, higher bed resistance causes lower sediment transport.

# 2.0 Installation and setup guides

Visit the section of the text below for more information on installing and executing the FloodingModule program on your computer. 

_Note that if you have a full Matlab license,_ there is a section at the end for running the module from source. This method is recommended over using the MCR if possible.

## 2.1 Windows (Windows 10)
* Visit the 'download' folder of this repository ([https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach/tree/master/flooding_risk/download](./download)) and download the 64-bit Windows 10 FloodingModule installer.
* Run the installer by navigating to the download directory and executing the installer by double clicking. Note that you may have to run this as administrator, depending on where you intend to install the program and Matlab MCR.
* Follow the default options. If you must make any changes during the install process, be sure to note them (e.g., the install location), as you will may this information to run the module program.
* You can now run the program by navigating to the install location. 
  * note that the program may take up to a minute to launch the first time.
  
## 2.2 Mac OS
